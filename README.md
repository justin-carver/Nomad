<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Nomad is a simple, lightweight, customizable, blogging system built on `Next.js` and the `Mantine` component library. The core post database systems is built off of `postgreSQL` with a `prisma` adapter, while using `next-auth` credentials alongside `encrypted JWTs` to handle administrative operations within the CMS.

The purpose of this project is to help beginners understand systems design within full stack applications, namely this Content Management System (CMS). The CMS Nomad is utilizing is simple and intuitive, yet teaches basic DevOps and security fundamentals. As well, this repo will serve as a teaching point to those looking to learn:

-   SEO / Marketing
-   Database Management
    -   PostgreSQL
    -   Prisma
-   Full Stack Applications
-   Authentication & Authorization

This application is still in a beta phase, so I apologize for any inconvenience or downtime! At it's current state, there should be no threat between upgrading versions.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/justin-carver/Nomad.git
    ```
2. Install yarn packages
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
3. Create and configure your `.env.local` file, which contains many fields for Nomad to function.
    ```js
    ADMIN_USERNAME = nomad
    ADMIN_PASSWORD = N0m4d4Lyfe
    NEXTAUTH_API = http://localhost:3000/
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET = noj345hoipdufpio345opi345/i4j5oui345o=
    ```
4. Create database tables in the `postgreSQL` client and spin up the databases using the correct schema information.
5. Run `yarn dev` while developing and `yarn build` before pushing to production!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

To create a post, simply start the server, navigate to `/login`, and sign in with the information provided in the `.env.local` file containing your `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` fields. Once signed in, if not redirected, navigate to `/dashboard` to view your options and either create a new post or edit a draft.

<!-- FAQ -->

## FAQ

**1. Why is the credentials provider used instead of something like Github or OAuth?**

Since this project is focused on being lightweight, easy to understand, and only support one author for blogs, the easiest route was to use the credential provider. The local .env file is safely stored on the server and cannot be accessed by any clients, while providing a great way to validate author information without having to host multiple database tables. `Next-Auth` also generates encrypted JWTs along with every session that is used to validate connection attempts.

I would **not** use only a password-based system for any important, scalable authentication methods. Since this blog's needs are simple, this was the easiest way. As well, when using a password, a complex, lengthy password is preferred. You can go as far as encrypting it before transit, but HTTPS **should** be enabled by default on the server.

**2. Can I just use this like it is? Is there a lot of setup?**

There is not a lot of setup to get this going, and you definitely can use this CMS 'out of the box' after cloning/forking the repo. Once downloaded, either start the server using `yarn dev` or `yarn start` after making sure to run `yarn install` to install/upgrade your dependencies, and verifying your local postgreSQL database, and `.env.local` files are created and setup properly. Once configured, follow the steps in the [usage](#usage) category above to begin posting.

<!-- Project Ideas -->

## Project / Fork Ideas

Here are some great ideas that will make this project even more interesting, and may serve as a unique talking point for your resume!

1. Add multi-user authentication to the CMS. (role-based permissions?)
2. Use webhooks to post somewhere else automatically when you create a blog post.
3. Implement a comment system. Maybe even throw in an upvote system.
4. Design and build a component that shows how many viewers are reading the post in real-time.
5. Extend the REST API to authenticate and create posts from anywhere.
6. Convert the relational database into a NoSQL solution like MongoDB or Cassandra.
7. Create and import custom components into the Quill editor and toolbar.
